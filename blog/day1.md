# QTIPA Dev Blog: Day 1

QwkTech is relaunching, and we need a directory server of some sort. Reasearch
leads me to believe FreeIPA is the best foundation to build on in the modern
era, and has been easy to set up in sandbox vms, making it the perfect starting
point for infrastructure required to relaunch.


## The Whys

* Cloud platforms do not align with future goals of QwkTech.
* Want to move toward ARM + PoE devies to reduce ammount of rack power.
* Bought a few Pi 5 and PoE hats to get transition started.
* Chose Raspberry Pi 5 because
  * RockChip has bad support.
  * Pi 5 is common, easy to build off of other projects the right way.
  * PoE hats are cheap and common.
  * I know everyone is the bad guy, don't care where company is going.
* Chose Fedora Core because
  * I prefer Fedora/RHEL based systems.
  * FreeIPA requires Fedora/RHEL
  * CoreOS is awesome.
  * Set and forget.
